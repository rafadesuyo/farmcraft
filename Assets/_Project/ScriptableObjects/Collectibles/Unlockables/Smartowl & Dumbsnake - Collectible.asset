  name: Smartowl and Dumbsnake
  description: Smartowl has a sharp and impeccable logic. A deep thinker and always
    weighs his decisions carefully, analyzing every detail to find the best solution
    to any problem. He can appear cold and calculating, as his judgments are based
    purely on facts and figures, rather than on feelings or intuition. To him everything
    must have a logical reason although his own body is a controversy of logic itself.
